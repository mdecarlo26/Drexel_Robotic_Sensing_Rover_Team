Current Status Log:
Decided to keep Interupts so Encoders are updated quickly. Needs to be tested. (1/20/2022)
Testing PI implementation on Motor Library. Debating using Interupts or not. Problem updating new motor speed to Arduino.(11/28/2022)  
Imported Motor Functions into single file. Got Motor 1 and Motor 2 moving. Bought 4 new motors (11/7/22)  
Julie Created working PID Code. We can not get Motors to move. We created a Motor Library to house all of the motor code (old)
